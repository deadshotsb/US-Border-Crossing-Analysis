The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/us-border-crossing-data"> dataset </a> contains different features affecting the Border-Crossing of US. This project is used to analyse each and every feature and predict on the basis of the current values what can be the traffic caused due to Border-Crossing.
